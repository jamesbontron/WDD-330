        <h2>Notes of Master Mobile UX Lesson 1</h2>
    <ul style="line-height:1.4;">
        <li>If you design for the smalles, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality.</li>
        <li>The simple guidline is whatever you are doing, do mobile first.</li>
        <li>Start small and scall up.</li>
        <li>People don't know what they want until you show it to them.</li>
        <li>Fast loading and functionality will make people stay in my website. </li>
        <li>Accessibility is important. Place buttons, functions, menus or anything important where the user can easily reach them (depends on the device).</li>
        <li>Reduce image usage (Or use SVG/Webfonts), optimize and minify CSS and JS Files.</li>
        <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.</li>
        <li> You must provide the correct keyboard according to the type of input the user needs to fill in.</li>
        <li>Arrange advertisements so that they do not occupy a large part of the screen and never use pop-up ads.</li>
    </ul>
