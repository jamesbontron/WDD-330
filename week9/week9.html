    <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
    <p>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window). Cookies can be made persistent â€• that is, lasting beyond the browser session </p>
    <p>By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set. This is for security reasons so that access to the cookie is limited.</p>
