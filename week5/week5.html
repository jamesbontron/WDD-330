    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>There are three types of errors: system error, program error, and human error</p>
        <p>Exceptions are errors that produce a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
        <p>Stack traces are sequences that points where the error has occurred. </p>
        <p>Warnings are errors that aren't big enough to cause the program to crash.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Tips to check and Avoid Errors</h2>
        <p>'use strict'; inside a function, or javascript file to produce more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features</p>
        <p>JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code</p>
        <p>Feature Detection use the if method to check whether an object or method exists before using it and check if the browser supports it. Examples of tools that supports feature detection are Modernizr and Can I Use?. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code.</p>
        <p>console.log() method can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program</p>
        <p>console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console.</p>
        <p>debugger keyword will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.</p>
        <p>error objects can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs</p>
        <p>Types of error objects: EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError. The most useful properties of error objects are: name, passage, and stack. </p>
        <p>throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop. It is best practice to throw an error object rather than a message.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>try statement defines the code block to run (to try).</p>
        <p>catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.</p>
        <p>finally statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. The steps to create a good TDD are: Write tests, write code to pass the tests, refactor the code, test refactored code, and write more tests for new features. </p>
        <p>A good tool to use TDD is Jest. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. You install it through npm. </p>
