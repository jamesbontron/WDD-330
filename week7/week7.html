        <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this if we use an object for our function></p>
        <p> The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as an array description property to describe what the function does</p>
        <p>Memorization = If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property.</p>
        <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it's defined. It contains temp variables that it's only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</p>
        <p>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn't interfere with any other part of the program</p>
        <p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. If any properties have previously been set on the function, these will be lost when the function redefines itself</p>
        <p>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It works with an If statement where the part that repeats itself is the else section whereas the if will only occur once. </p>
        <p>Callbacks are a way to use your code asynchronously. Instead of waiting for an event to occur, a callback can be created that's invoked when the event happens. Events can be DOM events, such as the click and keypress, but they can also be events such as the completion of a file download, data returned from a database, or the result of a complex operation</p>
        <p>Functions can return a function to use the parameter as a method.</p> 
        <p>Closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program. Closures not only have access to variables declared in a parent function's scope; they can also change the value of these variables.</p>

        <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.</p>
        <p>Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.</p>
        <p>With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.</p>
        <p>XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.</p>
        <p>AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.</p>
        <p>A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background.</p>
